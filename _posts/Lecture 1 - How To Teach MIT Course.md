Some of the interesting topics discussed here involves:

- **INTERACTION.** Through voting, voting twice after discussion in small groups etc. you can create an environment where students are more eager to ask questions, also creates a PUBLIC COMMITMENT which is good for communication (creates also a dramatic tension). 

-  **HUMANIZE TEACHER VS CREDIBILITY** Jokes, expressing doubts etc. help to humanize the teacher and make the students more eager to ask question and share opinions. On the other hand, create a profesional image and showing confidence f.e. by using the class-room space and projecting effectively your voice.

- **DISCUSS AT SEVERAL LEVELS.** Self, groups and class. This are the levels at which discussion should take place. It addresses students with different thinking styles, from more introvert to more extrovert ones. This helps thinking and builds a bridge to collective participation.

You can sum up the ideas introduced in this video (General Principles of Teaching) in three groups:

In the section question, they asked about some interesting points:

- **GRADING.** I put it here because I think it was a decent apology about eliminate grading with a kind-of martyr story in the middle. But the point to take from this is that you should introduce changes bit-a-bit and not trying to change your teaching/grading model all at once.

- **ASSISTANT TEACHERS.** Maybe you should think about introducing little changes (one a week for example) step-by-step, focusing first in your research but trying to build some new habits in the teaching. Creating from scratch a new-wave teaching style doesn't seem realistic. TRY SMALL THINGS AND AS THEY WORK GROW THEM.

- **LIGHT TOUCH.**  You can do everyone participate with phrases like: Could I hear from someone I haven't hear before? Also students tend to watch you all the time, so relaxing should involve go outside the class or give them the back or something.

- **CONFIDENT LEVELS.** Overall the confidence level of the students are lower than you think. Mix up the level of the questions so everyone has something to say. Also with the problems you pose.

- **REGULAR CHECKING.** In this class, there is a last-minute poll via little piece of paper to check what points got muddy or if there is something student's doesn't like about the teaching. Here I left the model of questions he poses to the students.

My own interest

- **...** Maybe I could do a little pause in the middle, 2-3 minutes? Do I really need it?
